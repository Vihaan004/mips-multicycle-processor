# MIPS Multicycle Processor

This repository implements a MIPS multicycle processor, focusing on simulating and analyzing its functionality. The project emphasizes modularity and the educational aspects of processor design.

## Features

- **Multicycle Architecture**: Optimized execution of MIPS instruction set.
- **Languages Used**: 
  - Verilog (core implementation)
  - Tcl (scripting and testing)
  - JavaScript, Shell, Assembly, Batchfile, PureBasic (support and utilities)

## Key Components

- Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execution, Memory Access, and Write Back stages.
